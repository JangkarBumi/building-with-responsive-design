# Building with Responsive Design

In this project we learn how to make website pages responsive using media queries & using the mobile first approach.

We used thenextweb as a reference to apply the concepts that we learned.

We used three breakpoints here for the mobile screen, medium screen and large screen to adjust page layout and content depending on device or screen width it's being viewed on.
